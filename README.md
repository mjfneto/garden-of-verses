# 🌿 Garden of Verses

**Garden of Verses** is a front-end web application built with **Vanilla JavaScript** that allows users to explore and read poems from classic authors using the [PoetryDB API](https://poetrydb.org/).

The project features a **search form** and a **filtering/sorting panel** to help readers refine their searches and discover poetic gems in a more personalized and intuitive way.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Search Functionality**: Find poems by title, author, or specific keywords.
- 🧭 **Filtering and Sorting**: Filter poems by author and sort results alphabetically or by length.
- 🎨 **Minimal UI/UX**: A simple and elegant interface focused on the reading experience.
- 🌱 **Vanilla JS Only**: No frameworks—just clean, readable JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🧠 Future Plans

We aim to integrate **AI-powered features** to enhance the user experience and make classic poetry more engaging for newer generations. Potential features include:

- Summaries and explanations of complex verses.
- Sentiment and theme analysis.
